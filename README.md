This is a lite version of SLURM-2.0.5 with sacct funcionality only.
This a personal playground for testing new developments or ideas in
slurm  job reporting. This will never be distributed for broader
consumption.
This modified fork was prompted by my own need of migrating the slurmdbd
databases to the XDMod own databases.
